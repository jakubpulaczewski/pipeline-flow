Quick Start
===========
This guilde will walk you through setting up ``pipeline-flow``, running your first pipeline and understand the 
basic workflow.

Prerequisites
-------------
Before installing ``pipeline-flow``, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.12 or later installed on your machine.
- A python package manager (e.g., pip or poetry).
- Basic Knowledge of YAML (used for pipeline configuration).
- Access to required data sources (e.g., S3 Buckets, databases, APIs).

To check your Python version, run:

.. code:: bash

  python --version

Installation
------------
``pipeline-flow`` is available on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/pipeline-flow/>`_ and can be installed using pip or poetry. To install using pip, run:

.. code:: bash

  pip install pipeline-flow  # or better use poetry

Setup
------------
After installation, add the following import statement to your Python script:

.. code:: python

  >>> from pipeline_flow.entrypoint import start

You can either provide a file path of the YAML or a python string represented in a YAML format to the ``start`` function. 
The yaml file should contain the pipeline configuration. 

Configuration Template
-----------------------
Setup a configuration file for your pipeline. Create a new YAML file (e.g., ``pipeline.yaml``) 
and define your pipeline steps. 

1. Define your custom or community plugins in the ``plugins`` section.
2. Define your pipeline type (ETL, ELT or ETLT) in the ``pipelines`` section.
3. Define the extract phase in the ``extract`` section.
4. Define the transform phase in the ``transform`` section (if ETL or ETLT defined).
5. Define the load phase in the ``load`` section.
6. Define the transform at load phase in the ``transform_at_load`` section (if ETLT defined).

And you are done! ðŸŽ‰

.. code:: yaml

    plugins:
       ... # Step 1. Add your plugins here
    pipelines:
        pipeline1:
          type: ... # Step 2. Define your pipeline type (ETL, ELT or ETLT)
          phases:
            extract:
              steps:
                - plugin:  # Step 3. Define your extract phase
            transform:
              steps:
                - plugin: # Step 4. Define your transform phase (if ETL or ETLT defined
            load:
              steps:
                - plugin: # Step 5. Define your load phase
            transform_at_load:
              steps:
                - plugin: # Step 6. Define your transform at load phase (if ETLT defined)
