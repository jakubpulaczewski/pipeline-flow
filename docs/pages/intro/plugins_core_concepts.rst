Plugins
=======
``pipeline-flow`` follows a **plugin-based architecture** that allows users to extend the system's functionality by adding custom plugins. 
Plugins are reusable components that encapsulate specific functionality and can be easily integrated into the system.


What exactly is a Plugin?
--------------------------
A plugin is:

1. Any callable Python object that implements the ``__call__`` dunder method. In other words, 
a plugin is a function or a class with a ``__call__`` method.

2. Wrapped in a decorator that enables lazy initialization of the plugin and allows the use of custom arguments 
in addition to arguments specific to a given phase.

Why use Plugins?
------------------
Plugins offer several benefits:

- **Reusability**: Plugins can be reused across different pipelines, reducing code duplication.
- **Modularity**: Each plugin is a self-contained unit of functionality, making it easier to maintain and test.
- **Extensibility**: Users can easily extend the system's functionality by adding custom plugins without modifying the core codebase.
- **Flexibility**: Plugins can be added or updated dynamically, enabling rapid development and deployment.

Types of Plugins
-----------------
There are two types of plugins in ``pipeline-flow``:

- **Synchronous Plugins**: Plugins that execute synchronously and are suitable for CPU-bound operations (e.g. Transform and Transform-Load plugins).
- **Asynchronous Plugins**: Plugins that execute asynchronously and are suitable for I/O-bound operations (e.g. Extract and Load plugins).
