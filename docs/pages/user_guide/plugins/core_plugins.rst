Core Plugins
========================
The Pipeline Orchestrator comes with a set of core plugins that are available out of the box. 
These plugins are designed to cover common data processing needs.

Unfortunately, there are no built-in plugins available at the moment. However, as the project grows, we will add more plugins to the core system.
