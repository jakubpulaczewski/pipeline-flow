Transform Core Plugins
========================
The transform phase is where the data is processed and transformed. The plugins in this phase are responsible for
applying transformations to the data extracted in the previous phase.

.. warning::
    As of now, there are not any built-in plugins available in the system. However, we will be adding more plugins to cover
    a wide range of use cases.
